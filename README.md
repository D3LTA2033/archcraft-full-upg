A simple tool to fully update and upgrade your system with a single command—zero errors guaranteed. Offers two modes: with backup or without. Advanced mode may take 5–10 mins and will reboot into a Linux screen—don’t worry, just press Enter on your current OS (or the default one if unsure). For more help, DM: 0b.livion on discord!
